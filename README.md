# ECG-Based-Arrhythmia-Classification-Using-Deep-Learning-with-Convolutional-Neural-Networks-CNN-
This project uses Deep Learning with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to classify arrhythmias from ECG data. It aims to accurately detect abnormal heart rhythms for improved diagnosis.

Arrhythmias are abnormal patterns of the heartbeat. Normally, the heart beats in a regular rhythm, but with arrhythmias, this rhythm can become too fast (tachycardia), too slow (bradycardia), or irregular. The heart has an electrical system that controls the beat, and arrhythmias occur when there's a disruption in these electrical signals. Some arrhythmias are harmless and may not cause any symptoms, while others can lead to serious issues like dizziness, fainting, or even heart failure. Detecting and treating arrhythmias is important to prevent complications. ECG (Electrocardiogram) tests are often used to spot these irregular heartbeats.
